* My feet are size 7.5, and these socks fit so perfectly; room to wiggle my toes but no excess material bunching at my heels. 

* I wore these socks with my slim fitting tall boots. The thin material hugging my calf was perfect as I did not have to worry about the integrity of my boots suffering in their fit from thick socks. I rode in these socks initially in an arena in 25+ Celsius and did not find my feet to be clammy or overheated. At times I have experienced a chafing from other socks as their material is thin and constrictive against my heel or they cling; pulling them off with struggle and straining the material. The socks by D&S pulled smoothly off, and the fabric appeared unscathed.
