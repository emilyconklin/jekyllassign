Growing up in a small city in Northern B.C. Canada has given its challenges for all horse owners. Together we curse the cold, layering our horses in 400 fill before we even bother to zip up our own coats. Despite the frozen toes, it produces dedication and passion. A small community collects unique events, endless trails and constant learning, something I am proud to be a part of. Having pushed through school with the accomplishment of a BA in English, I decided to combine my passions into something of my own that also benefits others like myself; equestrians at various levels and disciplines with curiosity and passion.
