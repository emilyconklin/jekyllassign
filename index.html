<h1>Equestrian Evaluations</h1><Br>

<P>Equestrian Evaluations is based out of Prince George, B.C. Canada.</p><Br>

<P>The equestrian sport has a reputation of being a ‘high priced hobby’. In reality, we know the blood sweat and tears
  of the day to day horse life: mucking stalls, braving all weather, and dressing our horses better than we dress
  ourselves. But despite the consequences of our lifestyle, we love our horses, and we would do it again and again.
</P><br>

<p>My goal is to represent products from the perspective of your everyday rider. I believe in quality that isn’t
  necessarily compromised by smaller price points. An equestrian lifestyle doesn’t always need to break the bank,
  neither does it mean we or our horses, need to settle for anything less than the best.</P>
