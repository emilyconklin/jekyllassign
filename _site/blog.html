    <h2><a href="/2020/02/24/Dreamers-and-Schemers-Bootsocks.html">Dreamers And Schemers Bootsocks</a></h2>
    <ul>
  <li>My feet are size 7.5, and these socks fit so perfectly; room to wiggle my toes but no excess material bunching at my heels.</li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="/2020/01/09/Dublin-Performance-Breeches.html">Dublin Performance Breeches</a></h2>
    <ul>
  <li>I think these breeches are great, and I would buy them again. It also motivates me to buy their other styles of breeches to see if they are at the same standard as these ones.</li>

    <ul>
  <li>I love Purvida Healthy Horse’s Roll-On Relief Liniment, and will purchase it in the future.</li>

    <h2><a href="/2019/09/21/Twinkle-Toes-Hoof-Polish.html">Twinkle Toes Hoof Polish</a></h2>
    <ul>
  <li>I think that Twinkle Toes Hoof Polish is an awesome product. While it may not, and I don’t believe it is intended to be, for long term wear, it is a great way to add some extra flare to a show or to your day.</li>

    <h2><a href="/2019/08/17/Eskadron-New-Generation-Fade.html">Eskadron New Generation Fade</a></h2>
    <ul>
  <li>I do not know what North America has against fun saddle pads, but we always seem to be stuck with the same solid navy blues and blacks. Europe on the other hand, they got things right. Whenever I go on a fun saddle pad hunt, I always am drooling over brands such as HKM and Eskadron.</li>
