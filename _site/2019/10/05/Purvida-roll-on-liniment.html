    <p>I love Purvida Healthy Horseâ€™s Roll-On Relief Liniment, and will purchase it in the future.</p>

    <p>It may appear to be a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. Easy to apply, the style of the bottle makes application process even more effective and less messy than other brands. Natural, safe ingredients that work, and are safe for you and your horse are sure to please. I love how well it fits in your hand and how I can easily fit it into a grooming bag. This product is $50.00 CAD or $37.99 USD, free shipping across North America. Keep an eye out for it in your favourite tack store (Mine is Two Dark Bays Shoppe)</p>
