  <li>I do not know what North America has against fun saddle pads, but we always seem to be stuck with the same solid navy blues and blacks. Europe on the other hand, they got things right. Whenever I go on a fun saddle pad hunt, I always am drooling over brands such as HKM and Eskadron.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The unique colours and patterns these brands come out with is always something to be desired. Eskadron is always marketing their designs by going ‘matchy matchy’ with corresponding bonnets, saddle pads, boots, coolers, halters and grooming kits. This is genius because even though I have never been one to colour coordinate, Eskadron makes me want to suit up and strut in front of a camera. I stumbled across the Eskadron New Generation Fade one night when I was googling endlessly for new horse accessories, and instantly fell in love. This line came out summer of 2018 and I had never seen a saddle pad like it before, the geometric shapes and ombre colouration was truly unique. While there were many products in the New Generation line including an alternate spearmint/ink blue heart print, the smoking purple/ink blue geometric horse was my favourite.</li>
