    <p>I think that Twinkle Toes Hoof Polish is an awesome product. While it may not, and I donâ€™t believe it is intended to be, for long term wear, it is a great way to add some extra flare to a show or to your day.</p>

    <p>It comes in a variety of colours and designs, so there are many options to choose from. I purchased it from my local tack store for $20.00 CAD. I am sure it can be found at a comparable price elsewhere. Their website has a lot of other glitter options for mane, tail, hoof and body. Definitely worth checking out!</p>
