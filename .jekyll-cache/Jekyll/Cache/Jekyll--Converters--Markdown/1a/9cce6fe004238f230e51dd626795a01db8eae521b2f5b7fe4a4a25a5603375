<p>I have a little chestnut Arabian mare who has been my love since she was a yearling and I was just six years old. She has now just turned twenty and is ageing like a fine wine. I am determined to give her the best care that I can with regular supplements, health maintenance and tack to provide optimal comfort. We started late in training due to things such as lack of a facility or faulty â€˜trainersâ€™. I then decided that despite not having the experience or expertise, that I would attempt to train her myself. We have had our struggles and our arguments, but she has so much heart and the outcome has been tremendous. I participate in local shows, lessons and an occasional clinic. I am a firm believer in establishing and maintaining a strong bond with your horse and with that, trying new things and always setting new goals. I have nothing to prove to anyone other than that I love my horse and that she loves me.  \</p>

<p>In 2016 I took a tumble from an unexpected spook and broke my back. A compression fracture to my L2 vertebrae. Despite being fortunate in that I am not disabled in anyway, I do still feel pain and strain. While it didnâ€™t drastically affect me physically, it did affect me mentally. I had to get myself literally, back in the saddle again and, tell myself to power through, be better than I was before and to always get back on. Together my little mare and I have achieved our own greatness and are constantly breaking our own records as a team.  \</p>

<p>Not everyone is going to the Olympics, and that is okay. I am here to support and represent the rest of us; those who love their horses, have big dreams, a smaller budget, and are constantly learning and wanting to be the best they can be for themselves and their horses. So please read, comment and share these evaluations from an everyday equestrian.  \</p>

<p>Remember, always get back on.  \</p>

<p>Love, Tess</p>
