  <li>I think these breeches are great, and I would buy them again. It also motivates me to buy their other styles of breeches to see if they are at the same standard as these ones.</li>

  <li>They are so comfortable, non-restrictive but also very effective in the saddle. I have had these pants for about a year and the quality is the same as the day I bought them. They are very durable and unique. I have no problem wearing these around town and they are a favourite for chilly days. The price is not unreasonable, as they seem to average around $100. I purchased mine on sale from Wilton Tack at around $70. Wilton Tack also carries other styles in the Dublin line. This season they have come out with these specific tights in a really nice blue, they refer to as Navy. Because I have found my breeches to be a more rich green than the Olive colour they were stated to be, I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the Navy follows a similar suit.</li>
